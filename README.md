An app that gives accurate scale measurements on the go without the need to carry a triangular scale. Allows for a custom scale value, so it is compatible with drawings that are printed with and a variable scale value other than the standard 1:50, 1:20, 1:25, and alike. 

There are some apps that do this but none that do it without advertisements taking up your much-needed screen real-estate, and they only allow for the standard scale values to be selected,  also this displays the complete measurement in mm, meter or km so that there is no error in the magnitude which can easily happen in a triangular scale or other available apps)
